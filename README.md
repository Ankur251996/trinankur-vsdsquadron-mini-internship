# VSDSquadron

 TASK1

 RISC-V toolchain installation has been done successfully.
 Next,the task was to compile the C code, which calculates the sum from 1to n. For,this I used the leafpad tool and the command to open it is "leafpad sum1ton.c & ". After that, the code for sum from 1to n is compiled successfully. The snapshot below depicts the same for n=5 and 100. The command "./a.out" is used to display the output.

Now again compiling the same code with RISC-V compiler.For that we use the command "cat sum1ton.c". Here, we consider the case for n=100.

Next, we create a .o file and observe no. of instructions for O1.
