 TASK1

 RISC-V toolchain installation has been done successfully.
 Next,the task was to compile the C code, which calculates the sum from 1to n. For,this I used the leafpad tool and the command to open it is "leafpad sum1ton.c & ". After that, the code for sum from 1to n is compiled successfully. The snapshot below depicts the same for n=5 and 100.
